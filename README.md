## 🔥 Key Features Explained

### Adaptive Theme System
The theme automatically detects system preferences and persists user choice to localStorage. Theme changes are applied before the first render to prevent flashing.

### Auto-Reply Messaging
When you send a message, the system simulates typing indicators and generates contextual replies after a random delay (1.5-2.5s), making the demo feel alive.

### Theater Mode
Clicking any post in Discover opens it in an immersive modal with the image large on one side and details on the other. Backdrop clicks and ESC key close the modal.

### Staggered Animations
Lists and grids animate items with sequential delays, creating a smooth, professional appearance as content loads.

### Smart Mobile Navigation
On mobile devices, tapping the logo toggles the slide-out navigation drawer. The drawer has a spring animation and closes automatically when selecting a nav item.
